--Written by Lachlan Wilson--

This project was written in the Jupyter IDE. Both a Jupyter IDE file (.ipynb) and a python file (.py) have been included.
The following libraries and includes are necessary:
 - numpy
 - cv2
 - matplotlib.pyplot
 - math

For best results images should have one main object in frame, with it being fairly distinguishable from the background.
Fiddle with the thresholding and adaptive thresholding, both work best in different scenarios and with different parameters.
I have provided a bunch of test images which work relatively well or demonstrate the shortcommings of this project.

Feel free to modify and redistribute as you see fit, just reference me. 

Cheers, Lachie.
